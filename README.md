# Nepali-English Parallel Dataset

This repository is dedicated to collecting Nepali-English parallel datasets to facilitate machine translation, NLP research, and more.

## Folder Structure

- `/source`: Contains available sources (in PDF, TXT, or link form) from which you can obtain translations to contribute.
- `/dataset`: This folder holds the contributed datasets in `.tsv` format.

## Dataset Format

Datasets must be in TSV format:
```
Nepali Sentence [tab] English Sentence
```
> There is inconsistency in how `tab` button on keyboard is treated. So, either use `\t` or better use `\u0009` character same as in `./dataset/parijat_shirish_ko_phool.tsv`.

## How to Contribute

You can contribute by:
1. **Providing a translation source** (uploading a relevant document or link in `/source`)
2. **Submitting actual parallel data** in the `/dataset` folder.
3. **Inspecting and organizing existing sources** in the `/source/Unmanaged` folder.

### Contribution Steps

1. **Create a new branch** with a name that indicates the source of your data.
   ```bash
   git checkout -b source-name
   ```
2. **Add your dataset** in TSV format (Nepali followed by English) to the `/dataset` folder.
3. **Describe the dataset** in the `description.md` file located in the root directory (`./description.md`). Include the source of the dataset, the number of sentences, and any other relevant details.
4. **Submit a pull request** with a detailed description of your contribution.
